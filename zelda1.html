            The Legend of Zelda, released February 21 1986 in Japan on the Famicom Disk System, revolutionized the action rpg genre. Its creator 
            Shigeru Miyamoto wanted to create a fantasy world which players could explore freely. He based it off his childhood exploring
            the Japenese countryside.

            The role playing games popular at the time of Zelda's release were based on table top games. They included complicated stat based rules and turn based combat
            system. Zelda on the other hand was an action role playing game. Instead of turn based combat, the player simply presses a button to use their sword. The sword
            is an item just like any other item in the game and all items can be assigned to a button. In some ways this system is more immersive than the other popular
            systems at the time because the player has a direct connection with their character.

            Exploration
        </h1>
        <p>
            Unlike Mario which only allowed players to move right through an obstacle course, Zelda begins by giving players a choice on where to go. They can 
            go in four directions: north, east, west, or inside the cave. Even though the correct solution is to go into the cave to get the sword, Zelda
            immediatly communicates to the player that the game is about exploration and will not stop them from making the wrong decisions. 
            Even though the game is criticized today for its cryptic elements, at the time it was accessible compared to other rpgs of the era. Contrary
            to popular belief players do not have to bomb every wall and burn every bush to progress in Zelda. Yes, some helpful items are restricted to 
            cryptic secrets, but the path toward progression is communicated intuitively to the player like with the bush in the middle of the path that 
            must be burned to enter the eighth dungeon.

            Progression
        </h1>
        <p>
            The core gameplay loop consists of the player finding the 8 dungeons and collecting the 8 pieces of the triforce to unlock the final dungeon to
            defeat Ganon. They get stronger by collecting new items or finding heart containers to increase their health. Within each dungeon is a new item which
            may or may not be required for progression. Even though players having the ability to explore freely enables them to do dungeons out of order, there
            is an inteneded order to the dungeons and some dungeons cannot be entered without a specific item. This ensures a satisfying difficulty curve 
            and progression in which players get stronger both by increasing their skills at the game and by collecting new items. The player can also collect 
            rupees (the game's currency) to buy items from the shop and some items like the candle and upgraded shield have to be bought from the shop.
